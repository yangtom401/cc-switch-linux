## [Unreleased]

## [0.21.0] - 2026-07-16

### Features / 新特性

- Complete the OpenClaw configuration center with model catalog, `agents.defaults`, Environment, Tools/Profile, provider reconciliation, and an advanced raw JSON5 editor.
- Discover external OpenClaw providers, preview differences, import selected changes idempotently, and refresh live-managed providers during startup.
- Add host-wide Session search plus virtualized long-conversation messages and user-message outlines.
- Discover Skills from fixed supported application directories, preview source/target/content conflicts, and import them into unified storage with explicit overwrite and multi-app synchronization.
- Add Daily Memory search, full-content viewing, ETag-protected deletion, and pre-delete backups.
- Merge the upstream v3.15.0 OpenClaw, Gemini, and Codex provider presets while preserving local China-accessible providers and recording every merge disposition.

### Reliability / 可靠性

- Bind Session cursors to provider/search filters and discard obsolete frontend search responses.
- Preserve unknown OpenClaw JSON5 fields and future Tools profiles across structured edits; use SHA-256 ETags, atomic writes, and backups for configuration changes.
- Show failover priority, actual proxy route, circuit state, failure counters, and the latest external health-check time on Provider cards.

### Security / 安全

- Restrict Skills discovery and import to server-known source labels and direct child directories; reject traversal and skip nested symbolic links while copying.
- Keep Daily Memory deletion inside the validated Workspace root and require the ETag of the loaded file.
- Keep OpenClaw reconciliation previews free of API key values and reject stale apply/save operations with HTTP 409 `openclaw_etag_conflict`.

### Tests / 测试

- Add frontend API, hook, component, preset-sync, global-search, virtualization, Skills import, and Provider routing/health coverage.
- Add Rust unit and real Axum route coverage for OpenClaw JSON5/ETag/reconciliation, Daily Memory search/delete, Session filters, and Skills discovery/import.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-15

### Features / 新特性

- Add a desktop/Web runtime capability contract and host-aware UI boundaries.
- Add OpenClaw phase-one provider/default-model, Workspace/daily-memory, and Session Manager workflows.
- Add persisted Stream Check configuration/history and provider subscription quota summaries.
- Add snapshot-bound Session pagination with per-provider incremental scan caches.

### Reliability / 可靠性

- Add real HTTP proxy conformance for Anthropic, Responses, Gemini, Vertex, and Claude Desktop conversion paths.
- Preserve failover queue order, improve usage-presence parsing, and correlate session/cache keys with request logs.
- Add Claude Desktop process-aware restart status.
- Upgrade SQLite to Schema v7 and retain local Stream Check history across WebDAV restores.
- Read and restore WebDAV db-v6 snapshots/history while writing new snapshots to db-v7.

### Security / 安全

- Reject Session and OpenClaw symlink/path escapes and bind pagination cursors to a scan snapshot.
- Validate WebDAV manifest identity against artifact hashes.
- Prevent Web error responses from exposing internal failures, credentials, Workspace content, or server absolute paths.

### Compatibility / 兼容性

- Pin the upstream comparison baseline to `farion1231/cc-switch v3.15.0` commit `9e3f1689038febb36da08993cd47281426b5dd7c`.
- Return coded HTTP 501 responses for known apps whose requested feature is outside the capability matrix; unknown app names remain HTTP 400.
- Keep OMO/OMO Slim MCP and Skills mapped to shared OpenCode storage while continuing to reject proxy takeover.
- Keep legacy v0.18 JSON WebDAV snapshots as a read-only restore source.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixes / 修复

- Use a key-based sort for Skills update results so the release source passes Clippy with warnings denied on the current stable Rust toolchain.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-11

### Features / 新特性

- Add upstream-aligned native SQLite SQL export/import with pre-restore safety backups, temporary database validation, integrity checks, atomic replacement, backup management, scheduled backups, and retention controls.
- Introduce WebDAV v2 snapshots using `manifest.json`, `db.sql`, and `skills.zip`, with SHA256/size/protocol/schema validation, database and Skills rollback, and legacy 0.18 JSON snapshot compatibility.
- Trigger debounced WebDAV synchronization from persistent configuration changes while excluding usage, health, logs, and session runtime data; expose last sync status, time, and error.
- Add native Rust quota and balance queries for Kimi, Zhipu GLM, MiniMax CN/International, DeepSeek, StepFun, SiliconFlow CN/International, OpenRouter, and Novita AI.
- Complete Universal Provider workflows for NewAPI and custom gateways with save-and-sync, duplication, confirmation, backend preview, credential masking, and richer model conversion.
- Import MCP definitions from server-host Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode configurations with app merging, deduplication, conflict reporting, and no silent overwrite.
- Add Skills update detection, individual/batch updates, `skills.sh` catalog search/install, cross-app management, source metadata persistence, atomic staging, backups, rollback, and resynchronization.
- Store and apply timeout, retry, and circuit-breaker settings independently for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode, including `circuit_min_requests` and migration of legacy values.
- Distinguish blocking Provider form errors from confirmable warnings so incomplete relay configurations can still be saved deliberately.
- Add a Web-compatible Session Manager for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and OpenCode with server-host session scanning, search, message detail/outline, single and batch deletion, and copied resume commands without launching a server terminal.

### Security / 安全

- Restrict Session Manager message reads and deletion to canonical paths under known server-host session roots, including strict OpenCode SQLite database validation.
- Harden WebDAV Skills extraction against unsafe archive paths and preserve database/Skills rollback behavior across partial restore failures.

### Fixes / 修复

- Prevent Provider switches during proxy takeover from backfilling proxy-managed live addresses into persistent Provider upstream configuration, which could otherwise create a self-referential forwarding loop.
- Use the non-trailing-slash Session API route expected by the Axum Web server so session listing and single deletion no longer return 404.
- Keep the mobile app switcher within the viewport by scrolling its tab row inside the header instead of expanding the document width.

### Tests / 测试

- Add focused Rust coverage for SQLite backup/restore, WebDAV v2/auto-sync, balance and quota parsing, MCP import, Skills updates, per-app proxy migration/runtime behavior, and all four Session Manager parsers.
- Add frontend coverage for Universal Provider, Skills/MCP/session APIs, Provider warning confirmation, proxy settings, Session Manager search/detail/copy behavior, adapter mappings, and settings normalization.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-06-28

### Features / 新特性

- Backport upstream cc-switch 3.15.0 proxy reliability behavior for request forwarding, OpenAI Responses, Gemini Native, Copilot, Codex OAuth, tool choice mapping, canonical tool arguments, usage parsing, final usage deltas, IPv6, connection pooling, retries, and failover.
- Add provider health visibility, circuit breaker state, reset circuit breaker actions, and takeover/failover validation for Web/headless proxy workflows.
- Add Web Deep Link import for provider, MCP, prompt, and skill resources, including upstream-style inline config merge and confirmation flow.
- Upgrade WebDAV from one-off snapshot upload/download to usable cloud sync with automatic sync, backup history, restore, and conflict detection.
- Complete more of the Skills workflow with uninstall backups, backup restore/delete, ZIP/.skill import, storage location selection, and sync method settings.
- Align Usage Dashboard details with upstream usage workflows by adding date-range selection, pricing editing, richer request-log columns, cache token handling, latency fields, and unpriced usage visibility.

### Fixes / 修复

- Preserve Claude Deep Link model settings in both `env.ANTHROPIC_MODEL` and root `settingsConfig.model` so imported providers display and switch consistently.
- Improve AGENTS instructions so future feature work follows upstream cc-switch implementation logic and uses China-friendly mirror fallback when fetching upstream resources.

### Tests / 测试

- Validate 0.18.0 with targeted frontend type checks, Vitest suites, Rust proxy/deeplink/WebDAV/optimizer/cache tests, desktop and web-server checks, and manual Web/headless smoke testing against local relay providers.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-05-31

### Fixes / 修复

- Fix Usage Dashboard auto-refresh so relative ranges recompute on every refetch instead of reusing a stale end time
- Fix request logs so global app/range filter changes reset pagination to the first page
- Fix short historical trend queries that only have daily rollup data so they no longer render as empty
- Fix model-pricing matching for session imports and zero-cost backfill so broad prefixes such as `gpt-4` do not incorrectly match `gpt-4o`
- Preserve valid namespaced pricing matches such as `provider/custom-model:extra` when backfilling historical usage costs

### Tests / 测试

- Add frontend regression coverage for dynamic usage ranges and request-log pagination reset
- Add Rust regression coverage for daily rollup trends and model-pricing boundary matching

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-30

### Features / 新特性

- Add a full Usage Dashboard for proxy-backed usage analytics, including cost summary, token breakdown, success rate, cache hit rate, app split, and trend visualization
- Add request logs with filtering, pagination, per-request detail inspection, status/error visibility, latency, streaming, token, and cost fields
- Add Provider and Model usage statistics so proxy traffic can be analyzed by provider, app type, model, request count, tokens, cost, success rate, and latency
- Add model pricing management to the Dashboard and connect pricing updates to historical zero-cost proxy log backfill
- Add desktop Tauri commands and Web/headless `/api/usage/*` routes for usage summaries, trends, request logs, request detail, pricing, limits, data sources, and session-sync status
- Add Claude, Codex, and Gemini local session log import with incremental sync, cross-source de-duplication, and pricing-based cost calculation

### Notes / 说明

- Usage Dashboard data combines live proxy request logs, retained daily rollups, and imported Claude/Codex/Gemini session logs
- Session imports de-duplicate against proxy logs to avoid double counting the same request

## [0.11.1] - 2026-05-16

### Fixes / 修复

- Fix Docker/Web deployments that could render a blank page after login with `vendor-i18n-*.js: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'createContext')`
- Keep `i18next` and `react-i18next` in the `vendor-react` chunk to avoid runtime initialization ordering issues
- Add regression coverage for the Web Vite chunking configuration so `vendor-i18n` is not reintroduced

### Tests / 测试

- Validate the hotfix with targeted Web chunking tests, TypeScript checking, Web production build, full Dockerfile build, and a Playwright + Chrome browser smoke test against the built container image

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-11

### Features / 新特性

- Promote the Web/headless local HTTP proxy workflow from release-candidate validation to the stable `0.11.0` line
- Provide one local proxy port for Claude Code, Codex/OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, and OpenCode clients, with provider-aware routing and provider switching through cc-switch-web

- Add live takeover and restore support for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and experimental OpenCode client configuration
- Add adapter normalization for Claude, Codex/OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, and OpenCode provider endpoints
- Add Web/headless proxy API coverage for status, config, settings, test, logs, takeover, restore, and stale takeover recovery

### Fixes / 修复

- Preserve Claude provider `env` objects and normalize root-level `ANTHROPIC_*` fragments during provider formatting
- Fix default Anthropic Skills repository scan paths and migrate existing empty scan-path entries
- Restore MCP and Skills management entry points for OMO while clarifying that OMO Skills use OpenCode storage
- Redact sensitive query values from proxy logs and avoid leaking secrets through recent-log output
- Fix restore-status synchronization while proxy takeover is running
- Fix the release workflow so generated release metadata no longer overwrites hand-written GitHub release notes
- Stabilize the App integration test by waiting for lazy-loaded dialogs before asserting their presence

### Tests / 测试

- Validate the stable release preparation with targeted `tests/integration/App.test.tsx` and the full `pnpm vitest run` suite
- Add proxy, takeover, provider formatting, OMO mapping, and Skills install-path regression coverage across the `0.11.0` RC cycle

## [0.11.0-rc.3] - 2026-05-11

### Fixes / 修复

- Fix proxy startup failure handling when startup fails before runtime status is fully updated
- Fix client takeover failure handling so failed takeover attempts do not leave misleading running state
- Keep running restore status synchronized after takeover restoration
- Redact sensitive values in proxy logs more aggressively
- Fix the Release workflow so it no longer overwrites manually written GitHub Release notes with a fixed body template
- Use MSI-compatible prerelease application version metadata for RC3 Windows builds

## [0.11.0-rc.2] - 2026-05-09

### Fixes / 修复

- Harden proxy startup UX so repeated starts refresh status and show a friendly "already running" message instead of rebinding the same host and port
- Show a clearer error when the configured proxy port is already occupied by another process
- Prevent duplicate Claude entries in active proxy takeover targets
- Allow first-byte streaming timeout failover before any response body has been sent
- Prevent repeated proxy takeover requests when takeover switches are toggled quickly
- Disable takeover switches while a takeover request is in progress
- Deduplicate proxy start, stop, restore, and takeover success toasts with stable toast IDs and short display duration

### UX / 体验

- Clarify that "application takeover" modifies local client configuration and restores it on stop or restore
- Clarify that the default bound client is only a fallback when the proxy cannot infer request ownership
- Add per-client proxy test buttons such as "Test Claude" and "Test Codex"
- Increase the default first-byte timeout from 30 seconds to 90 seconds for real upstream environments

### Tests / 测试

- Add proxy takeover UI regression coverage for duplicate request prevention and stable short-lived toasts
- Validate the RC2 changes with `pnpm typecheck`, targeted proxy settings tests, and the full Vitest suite

## [0.11.0-rc.1] - 2026-05-07

### Features / 新特性

- Upgrade the Web/headless local proxy from the initial single-app forwarder into an extensible proxy service with provider adapters, runtime stats, live takeover, and restore support
- Add Web/headless local proxy APIs:
  - `GET /api/proxy/status`
  - `GET /api/proxy/config`
  - `PUT /api/proxy/config`
  - `PUT /api/proxy/settings`
  - `POST /api/proxy/start`
  - `POST /api/proxy/stop`
  - `POST /api/proxy/test`
- Add per-client takeover APIs:
  - `GET /api/proxy/takeover`
  - `PUT /api/proxy/takeover/:app`
  - `POST /api/proxy/restore`
  - `POST /api/proxy/recover-stale-takeover`
- Add proxy settings persistence under `AppSettings.proxy`, including listen host, port, upstream proxy, Web-server auto-start, logging flag, timeout knobs, and per-client takeover settings
- Add live config takeover and restore for Claude, Codex, and Gemini; OpenCode takeover is available as an experimental option, while OMO remains unsupported
- Back up takeover-managed live config into `~/.cc-switch/proxy-backups.json`, write `PROXY_MANAGED` placeholders to client config, and restore original files when proxy takeover is stopped or restored
- Add Claude, Codex/OpenAI, Gemini, and OpenCode adapter layers for base URL normalization, auth header injection, and Codex `/v1` / Gemini `/v1beta` de-duplication
- Route known Claude, Codex/OpenAI, and Gemini API paths through one local proxy port, with `bindApp` retained as a compatibility fallback route
- Add a Web Settings proxy panel for runtime stats, global proxy settings, per-client takeover switches, and restore controls without exposing provider API keys in the UI
- Auto-start the local proxy in Web server mode when saved proxy settings enable both `enabled` and `autoStart`
- Switch providers without rewriting live config while proxy takeover is enabled, so the next CLI request uses the newly selected provider through the running proxy
- Add in-memory proxy recent logs with sensitive query redaction and `GET /api/proxy/logs/recent`
- Add streaming passthrough with first-byte and idle timeout controls for SSE / chunked upstream responses
- Add first-pass proxy failover using the existing `backupCurrent` provider, including runtime circuit state and failover status fields

### Fixes / 修复

- Restore MCP and Skills management entry points when the active Web UI app is OMO
- Map OMO Skills management to OpenCode Skills storage, matching the shared OpenCode / OMO configuration model
- Fix the default Anthropic Skills repository scan path to use the `skills` subdirectory and avoid nested `skills/skills/*` installs
- Add migration logic for existing default Anthropic Skills repository entries with an empty scan path
- Fix Claude provider JSON formatting so formatting preserves the full `settingsConfig` object and does not drop the outer `env` layer
- Normalize root-level Claude `ANTHROPIC_*` environment fragments back into `{ "env": ... }` when formatting provider settings

### Notes / 说明

- OMO provider management remains separate
- OMO MCP and Skills management currently operate through OpenCode's shared configuration and storage model
- OMO Skills now explicitly explains that it reuses OpenCode's `~/.config/opencode/skills` storage instead of showing a misleading empty state
- The local proxy is an application-level HTTP API proxy only; it does not modify OS global proxy settings, PAC files, or Clash-style rules
- For safety, proxy defaults to `127.0.0.1`; binding to `0.0.0.0` is surfaced as a risky public-bind configuration in the UI
- Multi-provider failover queues, usage/cost accounting, and cross-provider request/stream format conversion are intentionally deferred to later releases
- This prerelease validates the Web/headless proxy and OpenCode / OMO Web UI environment before the stable `0.11.0` release

### Tests / 测试

- Add targeted proxy coverage for Codex `/v1` de-duplication, Gemini `/v1beta` de-duplication, Claude takeover env preservation/model override removal, and Codex placeholder takeover config
- Add targeted OMO-to-OpenCode Skills API mapping coverage
- Add provider-formatting regression coverage for Claude `env` preservation and env-fragment normalization
- Add Skills install-path regression coverage for Claude, Codex, and OpenCode install directories

## [0.10.1] - 2026-03-15

### Fixes / 修复

- Preserve stored Web credentials until a new API base login succeeds, and stop cross-origin username fallback from binding to the wrong account
- Harden malformed OpenCode provider sync by skipping invalid entries deterministically during live additive sync
- Persist provider snapshots after desktop `sync_current_providers_live` so sync results survive restart

### Tests / 测试

- Add targeted coverage for Web auth validation paths and OpenCode live-sync edge cases

## [0.10.0] - 2026-03-14

### Features / 新特性

- Add OpenCode provider management, config-directory support, and live config synchronization
- Add oh-my-opencode (OMO) configuration management with shared directory handling and plugin installation sync
- Allow updating Web-mode Basic Auth username/password directly from Settings

### Fixes / 修复

- Prevent OpenCode edit fallback from accidentally using the full live config object as a provider snapshot
- Deduplicate legacy `oh-my-opencode` plugin entries before writing the latest plugin version
- Harden Web credential updates with rollback on partial persistence failure and a minimum password length check
- Unify OMO app parsing behavior across relevant Web API handlers

### UX / 体验

- Add missing i18n keys for OpenCode / OMO settings and generic “add provider for app” copy
- Update release metadata and docs for the `0.10.0` release line

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixes / 修复

- Prefer the account home instead of the service home for Web-mode config path resolution when the two diverge
- Expand `~` overrides against the preferred home so Codex/Claude/Gemini live writes land in the intended user directory
- Fall back to legacy service-home `settings.json` and migrate it into the preferred home location on first load

### Tests / 测试

- Add targeted `settings.rs` coverage for preferred-home resolution, `~` override expansion, legacy override migration, and legacy settings fallback

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixes / 修复

- Fix current-provider update flow so saving/applying immediately rewrites live config for the active provider
- Preserve Codex MCP entries such as `relay-pulse` when updating the current provider, and refresh the saved snapshot from live files
- Support the current relay-pulse health response shape based on `groups[].layers[]` in addition to the legacy payload

### UX / 体验

- Keep the top app switcher scoped to management-view selection and persist that selection locally
- Lazy-mount secondary dialogs and panels to reduce startup noise while debugging the `0.9.x` line

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-11

### Migration Notes / 迁移说明

- CORS is same-origin by default.
- `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS="*"` is ignored.
- `ALLOW_LAN_CORS=1` or `CC_SWITCH_LAN_CORS=1` auto-allows private LAN origins.
- Binding to `0.0.0.0` still requires `ALLOW_LAN_CORS=1`.

## [0.7.1] - 2026-01-10

### Fixes / 修复

- CI 修复/类型检查修复

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-09

### Features / 新特性

- Skills UI status line shows cache hit/background refresh
- Web API base override with safer validation in `WebLoginDialog`
- Web mode reads live settings into default provider without switching current
- Web switch syncs to live config and returns explicit errors on failure

### Performance / 性能

- Skills repository cache with ETag/Last-Modified conditional refresh, cache TTL via `CC_SWITCH_SKILLS_CACHE_TTL_SECS`, and fallback to cache on fetch failure

  - **90% reduction in bundle size** (from ~150MB to ~15MB)
  - **Significantly improved startup performance**
  - **Native system integration** without Chromium overhead
  - **Enhanced security** with Rust backend

### ✨ New Features

- **Native window controls** with transparent title bar on macOS
- **Improved file system operations** using Rust for better performance
- **Enhanced security model** with explicit permission declarations
- **Better platform detection** using Tauri's native APIs

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

### 📦 Dependencies

- **Tauri**: 2.8.2
- **React**: 18.2.0
- **TypeScript**: 5.3.0
- **Vite**: 5.0.0

### 🔄 Migration Notes

For users upgrading from v2.x (Electron version):

- Configuration files remain compatible - no action required
- The app will automatically migrate your existing provider configurations
- Window position and size preferences have been reset to defaults

#### Backup on v1→v2 Migration (cc-switch internal config)

- When the app detects an old v1 config structure at `~/.cc-switch/config.json`, it now creates a timestamped backup before writing the new v2 structure.
- Backup location: `~/.cc-switch/config.v1.backup.<timestamp>.json`
- This only concerns cc-switch's own metadata file; your actual provider files under `~/.claude/` and `~/.codex/` are untouched.

### 🛠️ Development

- Added `pnpm typecheck` command for TypeScript validation
- Added `pnpm format` and `pnpm format:check` for code formatting
- Rust code now uses cargo fmt for consistent formatting

## [2.0.0] - Previous Electron Release

### Features

- Quick provider switching
- Import/export configurations
- Preset provider templates

---

## [1.0.0] - Initial Release

### Features

- Basic provider management
- Claude Code integration
- Configuration file handling

## [Unreleased]

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Runtime auto-migration from v1 to v2 config format has been removed**
  - `MultiAppConfig::load()` no longer automatically migrates v1 configs
  - When a v1 config is detected, the app now returns a clear error with migration instructions
  - **Migration path**: Install v3.2.x to perform one-time auto-migration, OR manually edit `~/.cc-switch/config.json` to v2 format
  - **Rationale**: Separates concerns (load() should be read-only), fail-fast principle, simplifies maintenance
  - Related: `app_config.rs` (v1 detection improved with structural analysis), `app_config_load.rs` (comprehensive test coverage added)

- **Legacy v1 copy file migration logic has been removed**
  - Removed entire `migration.rs` module (435 lines) that handled one-time migration from v3.1.0 to v3.2.0
  - No longer scans/merges legacy copy files (`settings-*.json`, `auth-*.json`, `config-*.toml`)
  - No longer archives copy files or performs automatic deduplication
  - **Migration path**: Users upgrading from v3.1.0 must first upgrade to v3.2.x to automatically migrate their configurations
  - **Benefits**: Improved startup performance (no file scanning), reduced code complexity, cleaner codebase

- **Tauri commands now only accept `app` parameter**
  - Removed legacy `app_type`/`appType` compatibility paths
  - Explicit error with available values when unknown `app` is provided

### 🔧 Improvements

- Unified `AppType` parsing: centralized to `FromStr` implementation, command layer no longer implements separate `parse_app()`, reducing code duplication and drift
- Localized and user-friendly error messages: returns bilingual (Chinese/English) hints for unsupported `app` values with a list of available options
- Simplified startup logic: Only ensures config structure exists, no migration overhead

### 🧪 Tests

- Added unit tests covering `AppType::from_str`: case sensitivity, whitespace trimming, unknown value error messages
- Added comprehensive config loading tests:
  - `load_v1_config_returns_error_and_does_not_write`
  - `load_v1_with_extra_version_still_treated_as_v1`
  - `load_invalid_json_returns_parse_error_and_does_not_write`
  - `load_valid_v2_config_succeeds`
